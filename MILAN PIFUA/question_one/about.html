<div class="my-bio">
     Hello world! I'm Milan Pifua a student at WITI and am pursuing a Diploma in Computer Science. When I finish my course, I would like to become a web developer. It amazes me alot when I code and see the front-end of my code.
    With this changing world, Technology has made life easy, so each and everyone has to avail themselves to adapt to the upgrade and learn more.</p>
    I really feel that I can do lots of creations with whatever I have learnt. By the time I will be finishing , I will have enjoyed the fruits of an IT person. <br> Am looking forward to more opportunites  in the tech world. As a woman, I know competition is there with the opposite gender but am ready to challenge myself more in this field.
